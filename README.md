<b>WIP</b>

Rank sorter for heroes in Raid Shadow Legends

The csv data is NOT MINE.
<b>The csv data is from from ChoseN ( an older version of their spreadsheet)</b>
For an actual ranking guide, check out their spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZG6XQpqBBJ7Dbb_QmqHTvJkoSHUcfk7AX_yK5RDCi8Y/edit#gid=923921235

This project is to make a reactjs site that adds advanced filtering options / sorting options / color coded list to any csv of Raid Shadow Legends Champion rankings.

This was hardcoded at the time of making to support just the csv present in this project.
